# Winthemers' Firefox Guides
Firefox is one of the world's leading web browsers. With up to date features, advanced web technology and profile sync, it is used by most IT professionals, and is maintained by Mozilla Inc. as a free, open source and for the people. But what makes it even better is that since the entire UI is CSS, you can actually use a custom UI for your copy of Firefox! And, many creators have already worked on them, to make gorgeous and amazing themes.

But how do you install it?

Here's the guide!

### Installation Steps
> Copy the `chrome` and `configuration` folders into your Firefox Profile directory. Here are the detailed install steps:
> 1. Go to `about:support` in Firefox.
> 2. Search for Application Basics, find Profile Directory and click on Open Directory.
> 3. Copy the folders mentioned above into the Profile folder (usually has `-release` at the end).
> 4. This step is crucial. If you do it wrong, you can brick your Firefox installation.
>     1. Go to `about:config` in Firefox.
>     2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true` by clicking on the arrow button.
> 5. Restart Firefox.
> 6. You're done!
